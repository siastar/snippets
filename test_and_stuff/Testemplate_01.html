<p>In this example, we have created a header, two columns/boxes and a footer. On smaller screens, the columns will stack on top of each other.</p>
<p>Resize the browser window to see the responsive effect (you will learn more about this in our next chapter - HTML Responsive.)</p>

    including versions of Lorem Ipsum type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

     passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. 
     All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
      first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a 
      handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum 
      is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.Ã¹
